# IHM-princessProject
The little princess is a 3rd person game where the main character, a little princess from a different planet, explores different worlds in order to understand the life of earthlings.
| Worlds  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **World 1: Museum of form and motion** | The princess will explore a museum and will meet the animations that we made in the TD3 |
| **World 2: The Arena of Interaction and Competition** | The princess will have the opportunity to participate in a car race |
| **World 3: San Juan de Ruiz** | The princess will explore a little medieval village and will help the villagers in order to get all the keys to open the wall that encloses the village |
